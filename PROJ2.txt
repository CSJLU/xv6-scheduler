# Changing race condition to child first

Create fork_winner system call to set child first/parent first
To do so, system call is made (files involved: user.h, syscall.h, usys.S, sysproc.c, syscall.c, proc.h)
Global variable named forkwinner is declared in proc.c and externed in proc.h so that forkwinner in proc.c can be modified by function in another file
fork_winner function that is defined in sysproc.c stores user argument of either 1 or 0 to forkwinner variable (0 = parent, 1 = child_first)
Code is added to fork() which exists in proc.c. The code calls yield if forkwinner is equal to 1, essentially switching to the child-first policy.
